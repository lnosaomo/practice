                <p>
                    I got introduced into the world of information technology as a very curious teenager who had just
                    graduated high school. I grew up in a third world country where owning a personal computer was not
                    so common and I was considered privileged to be a child from a family who owned a desktop computer.
                    My father brought it home as a gift to me when a friend who didn’t need it any more gave him. It was
                    with that computer that I learned how to type and very occasionally, when we would buy access to
                    connect with 3g, surf the internet.
                   
                </p>
               
               
                <p>When my family immigrated to the united states, our neighbors and church members welcomed us and gave
                    us gifts to make the transition easier for us. One of the gifts I received was a laptop from a
                    family friend for me to use for school. It was with that laptop that I began to find the answers to
                    questions I always had. One search result for the question to “how are websites made” led me to Code
                    Academy where I enrolled in various web development courses and began to design websites. I was in
                    awe when the code I wrote ran and rendered a static html page. I continued to take many classes,
                    increasing my knowledge.
                </p >
                   
                  <p>
                    When the time came to choose a community college major, I wanted to study computer science, but I
                    decided not to because I had the fear of failing since I didn’t have any computer science education
                    in high school and the I felt the little knowledge I had was just a drop in the ocean of the
                    completer science. I choose the next choice I had—Accounting, which aligned with my love of numbers,
                    business knowledge and processes. Despite this, I remained passionate and continued to design
                    websites and learn about computers.
                </p>  
            <p>  
                    Although I did very well in my accounting curriculum, when it became time to transfer to a four-year
                    college, I decided to go for a major that would receive my credits from community college and allow
                    me to continue in a major where I could learn and do more with technology. I decided to major in
                    Business Analytics and Information Technology (BAIT) which was the only technology focused major in
                    the business school.
