                I am a dedicted, impactful individual whose main goal in life is to add
                value to the lives of others. For the past five years I have worked as a
                youth minister at my church focused working with youths to provide a
                safe enviorment for them to express themselves and learn about how to
                live impactful lives. When I am not at work, I am creating the next
                activity/teaching guides that will be helpful for the youths I work
                with.

                    I am also an avid reader who enjoys the comfort of relaxing on my porch,
                    reading a book. I have always enjoyed reading and would often stay in my
                    room hours as a kid poring over an interesting book or in the library
                    selecting what my next reading would be. I enjoy both Fictional annd
                    non-fictinal books. For fictional readings, I particularly enjoy reading
                    African literature and Authors. For non-fictional reading, I enjoy
                    reading topics related to the Economy and Organizational Psychology.
                    Some of my favorite titles, both fictional and non-fictional include:

                        I also creativly express myself using beads and gold/silver wire to create
                        beautiful pieces of jewelry. The part of bead making that I enjoy the
                        most are learning a new beading technique for a new jewelry project.
